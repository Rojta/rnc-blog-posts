## General Rules

1. **Common Courtesy:** Race ''N'' Chase strives to be a friendly server for everyone, no matter their race, religion, gender, beliefs, views, nationality or anything of similar nature, and any insults based on those factors will not be tolerated. Friendly insults and taunts are allowed, but you should know your and others'' boundaries - being a pain in the ass**. can result in a punishment too. The server staff is allowed to punish players for this rule on their own discretion, if they deem it necessary.
   **Being a pain in the ass -> constantly repeating the same insults, or harassing a certain player; Example: spamming "bad aim" to a player after every kill you get.

2. **Common Sense:** Use your head and think twice before doing something. In most cases, if you feel like something you''re doing is wrong, then it''s probably wrong. Doing something stupid and being a smartass saying "but it''s not in the server rules!!" will only result in your punishment getting prolonged.

3. **Foreign Languages:** The main language on Race ''N'' Chase is English, therefore you are expected to write and speak English in any public voice/text chat (aka chat visible by all players on the server, no matter their language), no matter if you''re talking to your friends or not. Language chat, clan chat, squad chat, and PMs are exempt from this rule.

   > NOTE: This rule is pending updates to fit the new Multi-Language system on RnC.

4. **Bug Abuse:**

- GTA V bugs: Since GTA V bugs are usually something we cannot fix, you are not permitted to abuse any game-related bug that can give you an advantage. For example, going into places where you become invisible or invincible.
- Server/script bugs: If you stumble upon a server/script-related bug, you are required to report it immediately! If the bug is something minor, report it in #deleted-channel If the bug is major (e.g. duplication exploits, free XP exploits...), report it via the ticket system.
  > NOTE: Abusing any bug or exploit that gives you any kind of asset and failing to report it immediately may result in your account getting wiped.

1. **Voice Chat:** Using the voice chat to harass and intentionally ruin other players'' experience is not allowed. This includes the usage of soundboards (or, generally playing music and sound effects in voice chat) - as long as all players are okay with it, you are allowed to do it.<br>
   If your microphone is too loud, and other players inform you that it''s too loud, you are obligated to turn your microphone volume down. Ignoring them and continuing to ear-rape other players may result in a mute.

1. **Hacking:** This server has a zero-tolerance policy against hackers. Whether you were just "testing" something, or entered with a hack "by accident" - we don''t care - you''re out. EVERY account that gets banned for any form of hacking WILL BE DELETED once you appeal your ban. _(If you appeal and prove your innocence, obviously, your account will remain intact)_<br>
   Please, grow up, and play fairly. This server is mainly for fun, and there is nothing significant to gain from hacking. If you think there is, you should reflect on your life and yourself as a person. The risk is not worth it, because you will be caught eventually.

1. **Account Sharing:** For security purposes, sharing your account with others players is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN and may result in a ban from the server and your account getting deleted upon being unbanned.
   There is absolutely no reason you should be sharing your account with someone else. If you believe there is, please open a support ticket first and wait for a Manager to give you the permission to do so.

## Copchase Rules

1. **Skipping Rounds:** Intentionally going to the lobby and skipping a copchase round every time you''re not a fugitive is forbidden. Please play fairly and be patient until its your turn. If you wish to increase your chances of being a fugitive, consider purchasing a donator rank as donators have slightly higher chances, or play some of the side-modes such as deathmatch or derby.

1. **Sabotaging Teammates:**

- Team-killing: Killing your teammates on purpose is stricly forbidden, and you will face severe consequences if caught repeatedly doing so.
- Trolling: Trolling your teammates is also strictly forbidden.

  Example: as a Fugitive, surrendering to the Police while your teammates are in the car with you; intentionally shooting as a Fugitive to gain the shot tag so your car gets destroyed; ramming your teammates'' vehicles...

1. **Ramming Players:** Car-to-car ramming is allowed for cops in order to stop the fugitives. If the fugitives are unable to move, you are not allowed to repeatedly ram their car until the engine dies - go outside and drag them out (through the Quick-Action menu).

**Car-to-PLAYER** ramming is allowed only in rare circumstances where the victim deliberately puts themselves into the danger of being rammed. Generally, ramming players with a vehicle is strictly forbidden and you will be punished if caught doing so. We understand a sync issue may sometimes occur, and you may be let off with a warning the first time.<br>
**Example of ALLOWED car-to-player ramming:**
A fugitive is being chased by cops on the highway, and they jump out of the vehicle even though there''s cars driving behind them at full speed. Cops have no way of steering to avoid the fugitive fast enough - this is when they are ALLOWED to ram the fugitive.

**Example of NON-ALLOWED car-to-player ramming:**
A fugitive is running on foot and a cop is struggling to catch up to them. The cop then takes their vehicle and decides to ram the fugitive a bit in order to stop them. This is NOT ALLOWED and you will be punished for doing so.

1. **Spectator Abuse:** As a lobby player, you are allowed to /spec players in copchase, and you are allowed to communicate with them (as long as you are not deliberately trying to interrupt them). However, using the spectate system to reveal players'' locations isn''t allowed.

1. **Engaging in shootouts:** Fugitives are allowed to shoot at the cops at any time, however, intentionally shooting in order to sabotage your teammates is forbidden.

- Cops are allowed to shoot at Fugitives only in the following scenarios:
  The fugitive has a shot tag, aka has opened fire.
  The fugitive stole a police or parked vehicle - you are allowed only to shoot at the vehicle, and not the player(s) inside of it.

1. **Fair Play:** There are scenarios where a player from one team might find a method or a way to definitively secure a match win, making the situation completely unfair for the other team that can''t gain an advantage in any way. The server admins are allowed to take measures at their own discretion in order to balance out the game in such situations.

**Example:** A fugitive starts climbing one of the highest cranes in the game, that takes minutes to climb. He cannot be killed due to ladder protection, and due to cops not being able to aim so high. Such situation is completely unfair for the police team, as the fugitive can intentionally stay on the ladder until the round ends. In such scenario, an admin is allowed to, e.g. spawn a helicopter for the police team to level out the playing field.
**Note:** Admins should **NOT** punish players if they believe someone is breaking this specific rule, as long as no bugs have been abused in the process. They are allowed to find alternatives to balance the game out for both teams, or do nothing at all. This is to ensure that players do not get punished for non-existent rules.

1. **Helicopter Abuse:** Using the helicopters to heli-blade (or generally fly into) players or vehicle is forbidden, and will be treated as a form of Ramming.

## Deathmatch Rules

1. **Teaming:** Teaming with other players in deathmatch is not allowed. Deathmatch is a free-for-all mode and teaming with players makes it unfair against those who are alone. Therefore to ensure fair play, the admins may kick you from, or temporarily ban you from playing deathmatch if you''re caught teaming.

## Freeroam Rules

1. **Harassment:** You are not allowed to, in any way (unless given permission from the player) , harass other players in freeroam. You may receive a temporary ban from freeroam if caught doing so.

Example: constantly joining a player''s world and using /goto to go and harass them by e.g. killing them, crashing your car into them, etc.

## Other Rules

1. **Reporting a player:** Players may be reported in-game using the /report command - this command should generally be used for offences that can be proven on-the-spot (e.g. toxicity).

If you want to report someone for something that can''t be proven without valid evidence (e.g. you were rammed in copchase), you should use the ticket system ( `「?」create-ticket` ) and report the player there, with proper evidence.

If you catch a hacker, DON''T CALL THEM OUT PUBLICLY - this gives them a chance to turn off their hacks before a staff member gets to investigate them.

1. **Reporting a staff member:** Everyone makes mistakes. Unless you believe a staff member intentionally abused their powers against you with intent of ruining your experience, you should try to resolve the situation with them first before reporting.

If you wish to report a staff member, use the `「?」create-ticket` system, and inform the staff that you wish to file a staff report. A senior admin or higher will then respond to your ticket when they''re available.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your report and have strong evidence and valid reason for it, only then are you allowed to contact the server management privately about the situation.

1. **Rule Updates:** The server rules are subject to updates in the future. Your obligation as a player is to stay up-to-date with the server rules. We will make sure to notify everyone whenever there is an important rule change.

## Discord Rules

1. **Discord''s ToS:** Please be mindful of Discord''s ToS when posting content in this server. Allowing content that breaks ToS would put our server at a risk of being banned, therefore there will be zero tolerance on such content.

1. **Common Courtesy:** Please be respectful when interacting with other members on the server. Toxicity and harassment of any kind will be punished. Friendly insults are okay, but please know your boundaries.

1. **Common Sense:** Use your head and think before you send something.

1. **Explicit Content:** Explicit content is allowed only in the age-restricted channel(s) (e.g. `「?」memes-and-pics`).

1. **Pinging:** Pinging the server staff for administration-related requests is forbidden - if you need staff support, use the ticket system at `「?」create-ticket`.

1. **Advertising:** Advertising other servers here is strictly forbidden without a server manager''s permission. ONLY the server management can give out such permission, no one else.

Posting videos of exclusively other servers that aren''t related to Race ''N'' Chase in any channel here may be considered a form of advertising (depending on the context), and you may be punished if repeatedly doing so.
