## Changes

### Weapon Damages - Rewritten & Balanced!
- Weapon damage sync has been **improved & optimized** and more shots should now register properly.
- Weapon damages have been re-written in a way that makes them more consistent and predicable.
  - Weapons will now deal the same amount of damage no matter the distance between you and the target. *No more dealing 4 damage for a headshot just because the target was too far.*
- Every single weapon's damage has been readjusted to be more balanced.
  - Damages are now different based on whether you hit target in the Torso, Limb, or Neck. Headshots are still instant for a majority of weapons.
  - Shotguns have been balanced out to be useful again. At very close range, Pump-Action Shotguns are fatal, especially if you hit the head. Auto-Shotguns are weaker when compared to Pum-Action ones, but they are also much better than they were before this update.
  - Different weapons in the same category might deal different damages. For example, Assault Rifle MK2 is slightly more powerful than the Assault Rifle. A Pistol .50 is obviously much more powerful than a standard Pistol, etc. We'll leave the damages for you, the player, to discover!  

- Anti-Peek has been improved in a number of ways:
  - You can now shoot while Anti-Peek is active, but the bullet will go where it actually should - into the wall, instead of through the wall.
  - Fixed some exploitable techniques related to Anti-Peek, such as being able to hold down LMB and going in and out of Anti-Peek to easily kill players.


## Fixes

- Fixed a number of clientside errors related to intervals and timeouts that were introduced as result of a RAGE:MP update.
- Fixed a bug where the 'Shooting Cooldown' notification after rolling wasn't showing up.
- Fixed a bug where /mute would show the punishment panel to the admin instead of the target.
- Two cops can no longer cuff the same fugitive.
- Cops can no longer kill a fugitive that is being cuffed, or is cuffed, to prevent griefing and kill farming.
- A bug *(commonly seen in deathmatch)* where the player you killed would sometimes die twice or more times in a row *should* be fixed.
