## Additions

- Blips have been added to the map showing MOST of the vanilla enterable buildings in GTA 5.
  - If you notice a blip is missing, please report it in discord with a screenshot of the location.
- Added a PUNISHMENT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT screen which will be forced on the player's screen when they get punished.
  - The player will have to hold 'Enter' down for 10 seconds to acknowledge their punishment.

## Changes

- Police will now get notified whenever a fugitive enters a building!
  - The building's blip on the map will also turn orange when this happens, allowing for cops to track down which building the fugitive(s) have entered.
  - This blip will remain orange until the round ends and won't turn back to its original color when all fugitives leave the building.
- Fugitives will now get a warning 60 seconds ahead of receiving the Shot Tag when the copchase round is about to reach 70%.
  - The game progress timer color will also flash red during these 60 seconds.
- Fugitives can now always see their teammates on the radar despite their visibility status.

## Fixes

- The MDC screen for cops has been fixed and should now work as intended.
- `/link` command should now work again.
- Fixed a number of errors which were causing server crashes & lobbies to glitch out.
- Fixed purchasing Donator Ranks & Namechanges in the Menu > Store section!
- _Other minor bug & crash fixes.._
