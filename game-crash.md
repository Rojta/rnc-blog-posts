# Try these steps one by one and check if your game works after each step. Don't do all of these at once.

1. ## Restart your PC.

   Yes, sometimes a simple restart is all it'll take to fix crashes. From my experience in the past, this numerous times.

1. ## Delete and re-install the server resources.

   This can be done by going into your `RAGEMP/client_resources` folder and deleting the folder named `a94414dd202051a80046dd6b934b142d`. You will have to redownload the Race 'N' Chase assets upon next launch.

1. ## Remove all mods from your game!

   Either move or delete your `user_resources` folder to another location. Some mods may simply not be compatible with Race 'N' Chase. If your game stops crashing after the mods have been removed, place your mods back into your game, one by one, until it starts crashing again. This is how you'll find the culprit.

1. ## Remove ENB/ReShade

   Self-explanatory, but it's easily possible that these may cause crashes too.

1. ## Disable antiviruses or any other application that may cause RAGE:MP to crash.

   These applications are listed in the `#troubleshooting` on the official RAGE:MP Discord: discord.gg/ragemp

1. ## Re-install RAGE:MP.

1. ## Re-install GTA V.

1. ## None of these steps worked?
   Then your next course of action should be to go and ask for support on the [RAGE:MP Discord](https://discord.gg/ragemp) in their `#support` channel. Unfortunately, there's only so much we can do to help you.
